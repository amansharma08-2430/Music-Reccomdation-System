# Music-Reccomdation-System
Listening to songs sometimes might be difficult for us. As, we have to search the song from the search bar then find the song and then play the song. Its whole is a long process and we might feel that we are not much interesting in listening as we are before searching. So, we are searching for an optimal solution for this kind of problem where user doesnâ€™t have to search again and the same music to listen or the similar kind of music to listen.  The main goal is suggesting best set of options to the user. For a specific user we had their song history frequency list liked songs. From all this information we had to predict what songs user might like then the question comes: how can we use all this information to achieve our goal.
